# How to install Linux Debian packages

For some releases Linux `.deb` (Debian) packages are available.
These can be installed on a Linux [Debian-based distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Debian-based_distributions)
(including Ubuntu Linux),
You will use `sudo` to accquire administrative (root) permissions on your machine.

After clicking on and downloading the installer file (ending in `.deb`), follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal
2. Change to the directory with the downloaded file:
```
cd Downloads
```
3. Use `dpkg` to install the file. The 'sudo' command should require your password:
```
sudo dpkg -i "WaterTAP-Flowsheet-Processor_*.deb"
``` 
4. Run the installed package
```
watertap-flowsheet-processor-ui
```
