                The IDAES Flowsheet Processor is deployable into a desktop application compatible with either Windows or MacOS (ARM64) operating systems. The application can be deployed into one of three different versions: WaterTAP, IDAES, or PrOMMIS. Each version comes with a custom styling and default set of flowsheets. The default flowsheets are provided by the parent projects, but user provided flowsheets can always be uploaded through the frontend after installation.

                    Once initiated, you should see the new workflow run added to the list on the GitHub console. Builds can take between 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the project and operating system involved. Once finished, the installer will be ready for download inside the workflow run under artifacts.

                    The build workflow outlined above has code-signing built into it. However, to run the code-signing steps, you must complete a few additional steps.
